# YouTube-Data-Harvesting
# INTRODUCTION
The YouTube Data API lets you incorporate functions normally executed on the YouTube website into your own website or application. The lists below identify the different types of resources that you can retrieve using the API. The API also supports methods to insert, update, or delete many of these resources.

This reference guide explains how to use the API to perform all of these operations. The guide is organized by resource type. A resource represents a type of item that comprises part of the YouTube experience, such as a video, a playlist, or a subscription. For each resource type, the guide lists one or more data representations, and resources are represented as JSON objects. The guide also lists one or more supported methods (LIST, POST, DELETE, etc.) for each resource type and explains how to use those methods in your application.

# Connect to the YouTube API:
You'll need to use the YouTube API to retrieve
channel and video data. You can use the Google API client library for Python to
make requests to the API.
# Store data in a MongoDB data lake:
Once you retrieve the data from the
YouTube API, you can store it in a MongoDB data lake. MongoDB is a great
choice for a data lake because it can handle unstructured and semi-structured
data easily.

# Migrate data to a SQL data warehouse: 
After you've collected data for
multiple channels, you can migrate it to a SQL data warehouse. 
You can use a SQL database such as MySQL.

# Display data in the Streamlit app: 
Finally, you can display the retrieved data
in the Streamlit app. You can use Streamlit's data visualization features to
create charts and graphs to help users analyze the data.
